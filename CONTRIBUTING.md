# Contributing Guide

### How to add a channel to the database or edit its description?

1. Download the repository to your computer. The easiest way to do this is via [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Open [data/channels.csv](data/channels.csv) file in one of the spreadsheet editors (such as [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/libreoffice/), ...).
3. Make the necessary changes and save the file.
4. Make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with all changes. This can also be done via [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

**IMPORTANT:** Since different programs process CSV files differently before publishing an edited file, please make sure that:

- no extra columns (commas) were added to the file
- only [CRLF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRLF) is used to indicate the end of a line
- no empty lines at the end of the file

## Channel Logo Guidelines

Since finding a suitable logo for the channel is not always possible, this list contains only recommendations and should just help you in choosing a logo from several options.

1. If the channel logo has several versions, it is better to choose a color one.

   That way there is less chance of the logo blending in with the background.

2. If the logo has changed over time, use the latest version.

3. If the channel has several versions of the logo, it is better to use the one used on air.

4. If there is a transparent background around the logo is better to cut it.

   That way it's much easier to scale the logo later.
